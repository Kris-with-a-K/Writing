Cool Air Rolls Off Metal
The tool looks like it was built to torture cars 
	now that they're getting too intelligent.
My boss says it's a come-along, 
	used to tension fences 
and that I've really had a sheltered life,  
	to not know what it's meant for. 

In some ways that is true, 
	I've never seen the fences built 
but I lived in Germany - 
	although we just missed Berlin
Took a trip down to Dachau, 
	and, later, me the Dallas Holocaust Museum. 

I was younger back then, 
	it didn't make sense - 
There were bodies made from concrete, 
	but that's not how people come. 
They had sectioned off a wing 
	that the kids couldn't be in.
I played, subdued, 
	with my brother and my sister, 
so I guess we were the same: 
	as the kids they brought on trains 
before they placed 'em in 
	the gas chambers. 

In Texas, I was old enough 
	to cordon off my heart myself 
But then I asked myself: but, 
	what if it was my brother? 
And the floodgates 
	straight crumbled. 

It didn't feel real, 
	and sometimes it still doesn't 
I went there with a friend who 
	supported Donald Trump running. 
Shouldn't let it bother me - 
	I'm a white man, right?, fuck it

But you've got Asian blood 
	and the fascists spilled floods 
First Americans in our 
	concentration camps 
Then the Japanese turned and 
	burned Chinese lands 
The Rape of Nanking and Unit 731 
	I'd tell you look em up 
if I thought you gave a fuck. 

Guess you really didn't take to
	your grandparent's cooking 
Rather bake 'em all in 
	Judgement Day's Furnace. 
And we talked about our brothers, man 
	Mine was in your place 
but I've wised up to damage 
	been wrestling since before 
we became equals; be a pity 
	to show anyone who tries to 
break this Union up 
	just what we can do. 
	
But we've gone off topic again, 
	and there's still work to do. 
As I leave the office, 
	turn left and grimace
A Confederate flag, 
	waving off in the distance. 
I'm on the job, 
	I gotta be professional - 
but then, I'm a paid pyro, 
	so I know what I'm meant for.
