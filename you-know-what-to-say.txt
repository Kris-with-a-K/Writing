You Know What to Say
My name is Kris with a K 
	and I am an alcoholic.

The last time that line was funny was in fight club, 
	but I'm not a Christian 
so going to the 12-step program is 
	off limits. 

Not their decision, they, 
	I quote, 
"Have a history of making room for women,
	African Americans and Gay and Lesbian groups."
I assume Agnostic Theists are included, 
	but we're not
on the list. 

Some of the queer and LGBT 
	crew can probably relate, 
but then again, I'm forgetting the 
	otherkin, 
	First People, 
	Neurodivergents,
	and other folks angry at not making the list. 

	I stopped adding 
		when a google search 
	turned up UrbanDictionary 
		second.

	Mythology (as a term) ranks that site 
		[???] places behind Judeo-Christian. 
	Astrology's placement should be fairly obvious, 
		but I'm off topic - 

This poem ain't for none of y'all!, 
	it's for Agnostic Theists
and anyone who wants to relate to us 
	the way I do religion. 

Because I do worship someone, 
	and wish to herald their coming!: 
The Personification 
	of the Elemental Spirit 
		of Humanity. 

Fuck your Greek and Roman bullshit 
	with gods having Titan-size problems 
and childlike id's. 

I believe in the best versions 
	of myself and my friends. 

The kind that could only exist after decades of 
	hard work,
	harsh lessons, 
	and large sacrifices. 

We have issues stacked to the moon and back, 
	to dismantle with the grace of men 
and the strength of femininity. 

I don't diverge 
	perfection and purpose 
from our emotions 
	and open wounds; 
I'm bandaging mine, 
	but not to hide them. 

See, one of my own flaws is, 
	I need attention; 
but not so much 
	that I read this at Alcoholic's Anonymous
or earned 
	an intervention. 

And, keeping to my creed, 
	I'll say that early detection stemmed from 
comparing who I see in me 
	to who I show my friends 
not a lack of them caring - 
	I'll share the wisdom, 
	paid for 
with strength and grace 
	in my inflection.
