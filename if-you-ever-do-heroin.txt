If You Ever Do Heroin 
I will break your fucking face and hope 
	you can feel it through the haze.

If you ever do heroin, 
I'll spit in your house and not visit your grave, 
	same thing.

If you ever do heroin, 
I'll report you to CPS and take your kids away 
Won't even put 'em up 
	if they at all recall in me your memory 

If you ever do heroin, 
	no meth for me, no mirror image - 
I am the mirror itself, 
	unflinching under your fists, 
reflecting the futility of your fight 
	against your own mistakes 
go ahead, take flight with another 
	hypnotic needle 
when you wake 
	you'll see the same 

If you ever do heroin, 
you will find from me no pity. 
You found the dotted vein and signed, 
	understanding you weren't risking anything at all - 
You have my guarantee. 

If you ever do heroin, 
	I'll wonder how it came to this 
after all our conversations, 
	you frankly admitting that would be the end of it. 

It's harder to share poetry about someone you still talk with. 
Pardon me for paring down this last piece, but it starts: 

My friend keeps asking me how she can help me 
It's impolite to say "Kill me and make it look like an accident"
if no one's sure you're joking, 
so I leave it at "Be the best person you can be,"
or sometimes just "You do you, man."

But heroin really wouldn't really be you doing you. 
It'd be you killing yourself and making it look like an accident. 
But I know better than the news clips 
and better than to joke about this. 

If you ever do heroin, 
I'll eat these words and not speak of you again. 
So don't pretend you had no warning 
on what will happen 
if you do heroin.
