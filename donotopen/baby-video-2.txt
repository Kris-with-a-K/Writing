Lyrics
	
Intro:
	shout out to my brother clubbing to the slow-burn bubbler
	got a preview cuddled with an ex lover on the leather
	so far ya man is just a boy, ya boy ain't even born yet 
	course, despite the facts you'd hate to see him aborted 
	he knows his fate and nature can't afford a weak performance, the 
	surroundings sure, what's inside ya's little more important 
	All around me pressure pushing back [b] keep my eyelids lowered 
	till the diamonds fully grown reflecting light into my shadows 
	
V1: 
	Haters throwing shade like it's a handout, pants down 
	when I'm on the stage and they in bathrooms, passed out 
	having too much fun with this a field day, track now
	hands down the greatest racing ever since the shot came 
	you a photobomber, just got lapped in the background 
	wiped out, sidelines, the game finish preg-enant 
	How? Well it's obvious, I'm still kicking it 
	the next stadium, there's really no ending it 
	
Chorus: [BREAK]
	Yeah! And let me tell you how it is 
	I'm a fucking sperm cell racing for the egg [/BREAK]
	so if I don't make it I know a brother did 
	just another wave breaking up against this bitch 
	
V2: 
	swiping out my crown, then you best prepared to take it
	libraries are shutting down across the goddamn nation
	and you got some late fees from checking out these fake dreams
	self-help books but you left em on your third vacation
	I don't think you'll really take the weight of your mistakes
	could you lay it on song that's long enough to fill the place
	cap it with apology and babe, I'm still here waiting.
	Praying for a chance to pull around and here it is
	
Chorus: 
	Just another sperm sperm cell racing for the egg 
	so if I don't make it I know a brother did 
	life's a bitch especially in the middle of a breakup 
	bit my tongue on dirt until I could control my breath 
	
V3:
	Just another worm, on the pavement when the rain ends 
	If the kids eat me I'm headed straight for they brain stem 
	Legendary name, I coulda taken Lil Bun - be the 
	hottest homemadest motherfukker up in the oven 
	concentrated on frying rappers, [b?] that's small fish, little dishes 
	someone call hannibal lector [b] I need a witness 
	bout to be elected best butcher shop is business
	nahh, I'm just kidding, acuz there's really no difference 	

Chorus: 
	so kindly remind me once again just what I am 
	I'm a fucking sperm cell racing for the egg [BREAK]
	so if I don't make it I know a brother did 
	just another wave breaking up against this bitch [/BREAK]
	
V4: 
	's why I keep a brave face a' don't buy entertainment 
	telling me that's how it is or to accept my placement 
	Idolizing fake shit like you never been afraid 
	while the timid masses imitate, attempting to be great
	own up to my weakness, yeah I wear it every day - you can 
	dethrone ya boy, the eulogy's already heavy, crew treading 
	steadily [b] bumping shoulders taking up my heavenly melodies and 
	I'm riding high the fun's on me so have it at my expense 
	
Outro: 	
	this be that baby video parents play embarassing they 
	kids in front of relatives - Promise you'll remember me 
	for just under a century, The 22nd better bring some fresher 
	ded poetry - Bet they'll pen an epic bout my end, you wanna 
	guess the odds? Sure, if I'm wrong, ghostwrite another song n
	you'll type it 
	life uh, finds a way
	what if you miss? 
	I won't
	
Final Outro
	And even if I did... 
	And even if I did... 
	And even if I did...
