Verses 
V1:
	iron curtain no avail,
	pierce it with my sonic wail 
	riding Orcas, killer whales, 
	barrel towards the biggest prey 
	and tear it up like ery day! 

	you be like some porpoise 
	beached and flipped while tourists all take 
	pictures with your corpses 

	meanwhile I'm electric eel 
	mean-mugging haters, yeah I'm eyeing up my next meal 

	you be like some salmon 
	staying in that maiinstreaaam 
	climbing ladders and not knowing 
	when you finally maaade itt 

	I'm some other school fish 
	mobbing deep like loyal does 
	my bruhs as savage as they come 
	so if you're tripping I would run 
	but if you're cripping want no blood 
	Slip and need a eulogy, 
	my crew'll spit it true to me  
	Closing up the ranks when 
	I take my place in history 

V???:
	Just another worm, on the pavement when the rain ends 
	If the kids eat me I'm headed straight for they brain stem 
	Rappers kinda salty when they find they cannot shaaake him [b]
	pepper every beat with clever heat to keep it sweetened and 
	they coulda called the emcee Lil Bun, 
	he the hottest homemadest motherfucker up in the oven 
	getting baked up off this concentrated mental image, me
	serving rappers fried up in little dishes [b]
	somebody call hannibal lector I need a witness 
	[b] bout to be elected best butcher shop is business 
	swung the vote, I stuffed the boxes with my enemies' limb's 
	nahh, I'm sure kidding, acuz there's really no difference 

	nahh I'm sure kidding n in the end 
	
	
	x	's why I still remain stable even when I'm faking 
	{bitch ass} rappers acting like they never been afraid 
	while the timid masses imitate, attempting to be great
	own up to my weakness, yeah I wear it every day 
	
G.F. verse: 
	checking out my crown, then you best prepared to take it
	libraries are shutting down across the goddamn nation
	and you got some late fees from checking out these fake dreams
	self-help books but you left em on your third vacation
	I don't think you'll really take the weight of your mistakes
	could you lay it on song that's long enough to fill the place
	cap it with apology and babe, I'm still here waiting.
	Praying for a chance to pull around and here it is

Outro: 

	Slip and need a eulogy, 
	my crew'll spit it true to me  
	Closing up the ranks when 
	I take my place in history
