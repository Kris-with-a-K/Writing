Title: I Kill Terminators
Beat: Zero Dark Thirty

Never did know what his purpose was 
Picked up another with burning blood 
Sitched on a smile like your first cousin 
The world of machines we yearn for love 
Yours is something that I just can't, touch 
lot to feel, get the numbers, crunched 
Come with me and run with it if 
you want to live in this judgement 

2029 I will about 35 
in the middle of my prime with a robotic eye 
Kept my family underground, 
now I'm fly as a ghetto bird 
The foreword said so 
The next show get low 
like nape of the earth, staying humble
hugging the dirt 
you a predator, I'm warning you, this mud is from Earth 
encircling the target like a nun around a rosary 
the last man praying for a savior 
John Connor, John Doe, anybody, let's go!

Running from a hundred hunter killers cuz 
they hate a pathfinder, that's sure an A* search 
Now I gotta trailblazer, Mad Max chromed out 
In the spotlight and I'll focus now 
Make the spot hot like a poster child 
Man draw the scene and the scene draw a crowd 
and the crowd all frown like "he tore the image down 
of our perfect child" but I did it with style 
Charge was arson so I split downtown 

From the Skynet guard dogs, but word gets round 



Charge downtown where I can't be found, met a man at the bus stop 
Ask me what the scars from and how you always bouncing
like his own checkbook and what the line of work took 

Turned in my seat, said I Kill Terminators. 

Well I kill Terminators, so guess what I told him? 
I build Terminator hell. 
d
Chorus: 
Tech-com with a steady signal on the net trending 
Heads numb, but my breath strong and my weapon steady
Turning they own subroutines against em 
Wanna kill a Terminator, better damn send one.



Reset the future beforre the threshold gone 
Waking early when the sun sets, job done 
We set the future so hold onto our loved ones 
You shape your journey as surely as the next one 

shot, one kill, double tap. 
mechanical keyboard jacked in, 
why you separated from the pack 
by a backdoor attack had the packets lifted 
CIA flight path to drop in Contra 
- dictory declaring victory before the end 

off from a single to a burst while I'm laughing stock 
bump against my shoulder that's a tap out shot 
holding the advance, god damn, why not? 
let 'em have the planet like we had our chance 

objective in pursuit of my protocol 
defusing these bombs with a gunshot to offspring 

I'm a magnet for the metal, I'm a monkey with a wrench 
I'll sleep when I'm dead, and I'll eat when I've fed 
upon the threat to my breathren 

from a single to full auto 
from an EP to an album 



show a life, that's a sign of weakness 
show a hands, who pays with their bodies just to eat 
raise a fist when you decided to stand up for what it means 
to be a human being 

Eyes wild with the information 
Arms on fire with the veins and tendons 
Mind restrained by the body lived in, and the 
Body driven like a chariot 

No comparing it, just once you're bitten 
and you wanna bite back so your teeth can sink in 
But our time is ticking, so great minds are asking:
When the slaughter comes, who's the lamb, who's taxing? 
Meanwhile in the back I'm like who gives a damn 


ABC's with the C4 explosive 
123 with the triple threat, homer 
signed by a kid who never knew his before 
his own demons that he built split the atom 
like a log for cabin; woodsy 
in a back lot but really could he should he bully 
nature in the hopes for a Hercules producing a beast? 
Turn the grass to a sandlot 


perpatrator/purple lasers 

like the Prophet of Regret 
had a preview of the end, yeah a vision of my neck slit 
paint a couple teeth on the throat like "keep spittin' 'em"
throw a couple blows like "buddy keep shittin' 'em"


cannot stop this judgement but I'll damn well avenge it 
iron man said it first, flesh'll have the last laugh 


Offspring, unscrewed 
but it's your music dude 
your churches, your schools 


Coloring our own lines, overclocking chipsets 
ready, steady, go 

Blasting contraptions, no metal on my audio 
scope - [hijacked/irradiated radio flow/iron man]

Rotate the turret, take aim, kill Terminators 
[Chorus]

> target painted (lamb's blood)

mark us 
fire in the heart like an engine -  
sparked up 


Trapped at the range, lock gate, kill Terminators 
[Chorus]
