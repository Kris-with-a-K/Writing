Title: I Kill Terminators 
Beat: Zero Dark Thirty

Never did know what my purpose was 
Picked up another with burning blood 
Sitched on a smile like your first cousin 
The world of machines we yearn for blood 
Yours is something that I just can't... touch 
lot to feel, get the numbers... crunched 
Come with me and run with it 
if you want to live in this judgement 

Come 2029 I will about 35 
in the middle of my prime with a robotic eye 
Kept my family underground, 
now I'm fly as a ghetto bird 
The foreword said so 
The next show get low 
like nape of the earth 
staying humble, hugging the dirt 
you a predator, I'm warning you, this mud is from Earth 
encircling the target like a nun around a rosary 
praying for the poster boy 
the last man hoping for a savior 
John Connor, John Doe, anybody, let's go!


on the run from hunter killers, that's an A* search 
got a gun from 

cannot stop this judgement but I'll damn well avenge it 
iron man said it first, flesh'll have the last laugh 

Turned in my seat, said I kill Terminators 


Tech-com with a steady signal at the ready 
Heads numb, but my breath strong and my weapon steady
Turning they own subroutines against em 
Wanna kill a Terminator, better damn send one 
Reset the future be-fore the threshold gone 
Waking early when the sun sets, job done 
We set the future so hold onto our loved ones 
You shape your journey as surely as the next one 


off from a single to a burst while I'm laughing stock 
bump against my shoulder that's a tap out shot 
holding the advance, god damn, why not? 
let 'em have the planet like we had our chance 

objective in pursuit of my protocol 
defusing these bombs with a gunshot to offspring 

I'm a magnet for the metal, I'm a monkey with a wrench 
I'll sleep when I'm dead, and I'll eat when I've fed 
upon the threat to my breathren 



ABC's with the C4 explosive 
123 with the triple threat, homer 
signed by a kid who never knew his before 
his own demons that he built split the atom 
like a log for cabin; woodsy 
in a back lot but really could he should he bully 
nature in the hopes for a Hercules producing a beast? 
Turn the grass to a sandlot 


perpatrator/purple lasers 

like the Prophet of Regret 
I had a preview of the end 
a vision of my neck slit 
paint a couple teeth on the bitch like "keep spittin' 'em"


Offspring, unscrewed 
but it's your music dude 
your churches, your schools 


Coloring our own lines, overclocking chipsets 
ready, steady, go 


strung along 


talking bout protection for the rest of us 
we got one bastion, never see it left to dust 


Blasting contraptions, no metal on my audio 
scope - [hijacked/irradiated radio flow/iron man]

Rotate the turret, take aim, kill Terminators 
[Chorus]

>target painted(lamb's blood)

mark us
fire in the heart like an engine -  
sparked up 


Trapped at the range, lock gate, kill Terminators 
[Chorus]
