verse 1
look you in your eyes, let the words fly on tempo 
locked outta your heart, I'll let you in, I know the combo 
the wrong number texted me till two in the morning 
we carried on bout life, like we doing all the time 
and she want a meet at night, but I'm busy with my writing 
fighting for a future where we don't need a lifeguard 
when the bath's drawn and you don't have your knife guard 
life's hard, after-hours swimming with the lights off 

chorus 
sparring with these artists on a backyard fence 
white picket in suburbia - chainlink in the projects 
the audience is busy with the BBQ and cousins 
mentally they're up here, like I threw em on a rope swing 
enjoy the view I'm hoping you'll not find any delays  
on your way to my yard, and I'll get off the chevalet 
showing off your scars and prison tats while Chevrolets 
all be pulling up and bumping party songs to start the day 

verse 2 
look into your eyes, let the tears fall, it's alright 
everybody's clapping for your man but let me thank you 
wouldn't be on stage without material you shared 
people staring like, "when that boy pop up?" but what 
they don't know is how long he been propped up
(and no I've got no plans to cancel my grandstanding 
gimme the backhand and I'll know where my squad's at)
crying to the song cuz they know what, he's on track 

chorus 

verse 3
happiness is delicate, what makes it, delicious 
I'm licking the little spoon, looking to finish 
so grateful I got so many of these full plates 
and if the hate don't stop we gonna armor up and roll straight 
through the microphone, through the wire, through the mesh 
all my gears been tested, not a cog in the machine 
and no brain freeze either, what you think the spoon eating
when the fog lifts, the night mission completed

chorus 



thunder shuts the pool down and follows you all summer 
got a black cloud, get around it, jump into the river 



we turn in, start sleeping, don't sleep on my people 
you'll find there's no equal to Kris K's speeddial
and you'll die on the tile a linoleum bathroom  

I don't want no wilted spinach on tomato basil sandwich 
my girl got back from spin class and her hamstrings got my hands on 'em 

not good enough, you gotta stay above 

captain of the keys when this MC on the mic 

look into your eyes, let the tears flow, it's okay 
x	you can drop the knife, while your shoulder blades clatter 
everybody starts to clapping and you kinda wonder why 
but before the question dies upon your lips I'm by your side 
OG Poet Dennis called it, boy is getting serious 

look into your eyes, let the tears flow, it's okay 
safe inside the cove, edge of paradise bay 
and you're underneath the stars 
	top of the world 
	sex jokes hahah 


she bouncing on a rubber, cuddles, falls asleep in lover's hands 
next things she knows, she's woken up at six AM the kids on trampoline again
