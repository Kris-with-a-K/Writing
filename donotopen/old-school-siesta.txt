verse 1
look you in your eyes, let the words fly on tempo 
locked outta your heart, I'll let you in, I know the combo 
the wrong number texted me till two in the morning 
we carried on bout life, like we doing all the time 
and she want a meet at night, but I'm busy with my writing 
fighting for a future where we don't need a lifeguard 
when the bath's drawn and you don't have your knife guard 
the pool's closed in thunder and it finds you all summer 

chorus 
sparring with these artists on a backyard fence 
white picket in suburbia - chainlink in the projects 
the audience is busy with the BBQ and cousins 
mentally they're up here, like I threw em on a rope swing 
enjoy the view I'm hoping you'll not find any delays  
on your way to my yard, and I'll get off the chevalet 
showing off your scars and prison tats while Chevrolets 
all be pulling up and bumping party songs to start the day 


THIS HAPPINESS IS DELICATE, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DELICIOUS 
And we stay fresh in the sunlight, don't get locked inside and shrivel 

not good enough, you gotta stay above 


look into your eyes, let the tears flow, it's okay 
x	you can drop the knife, while your shoulder blades clatter 
everybody starts to clapping and you kinda wonder why 
but before the question dies upon your lips I'm by your side 
OG Poet Dennis called it, boy is getting serious 

look into your eyes, let the tears flow, it's okay 
safe inside the cove, edge of paradise bay 
and you're underneath the stars 
	top of the world 
	sex jokes hahah 


she bouncing on a rubber, cuddles, falls asleep in lover's hands 
next things she knows, she's woken up at six AM the kids on trampoline again
