read me however you like 
I'll just say fuck it, I guess that you're right 
rewrite the ending tonight, 
changing the mindset to stick my vision
and after the credits I rise from the rubble, 
double production

> how you have a sequel when you killed all the enemies 
> nah I'm the badguy, killed footsoldiers but now 

go for the throat, cut off the head 
sever the rest of 'em, heart is collatoral damage 
I lost mine when I loaned it out for a bet 
Wanna go steady and write our forever? 
Steadily drinking myself to obl'vion 
My woman forgiving but I din't get better
