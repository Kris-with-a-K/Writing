tune: good goodbye 

					read me however you like 
I'll just say fuck it, I guess that you're right 
rewrite the ending tonight, 
changing the mindset to stick my vision
and after the credits I rise from the rubble, 
double production, I guess you don't get it 
How he write sequels when he killed the enemy 
If we was hollywood I'd bring 'em back again 
They bring me back when they need a new villain 
Killed all the foot soldiers, gotta just 
go for the throat, cut off the head 
sever the rest of 'em, heart is collatoral damage 				(rework)
I lost mine when I loaned it out for a bet 
Wanna go steady and write our forever? 
Steadily drinking myself to obl'vion 
My woman forgiving but I din't get better
