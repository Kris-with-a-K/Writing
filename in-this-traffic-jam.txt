In this traffic jam of my memory, 
I am a frustrated driver, 
banging on my steering wheel in the packed heat. 

The city is dense, 
probably somewhere with underdeveloped public transit, 
or all the poor people like me would be on the bus. 
Our shuffling would be muffled by 
the strained silence of strangers 
	sitting shoulder to shoulder, not
the blaring radio of cars 
	idling bumper to bumper. 

It's down South or on the West Coast, 
	but still south, 
because my hands get cold when I drive 
	and that doesn't make sense on the sweltering, 
trawling, eight-lane quadruple overpass highways of 
	New Orleans, L.A., Baton Rouge, or San Diego. 

I hate these cold, stiff hands 
so I simply imagine myself in a place 
where they can't exist. 

I'm broke and so's the A/C, 
	but that's good:
It removes the risk of chilling my body 
	at the cost of my livlihood, 
	my soul. 

Some think themselves a frozen machine 
to avoid their hunters and broken old haunts, 
escape to the icescape where heat sense can't follow. 

I'll take the metal, the nerves of steel, 
	the wiry muscles and wired reflexes, 
But my default operating temperature is one hundred degrees - 
	anything less than two hundred is the cold zone,
	opposite of my soul. 

But it 
	gets 
so 
	old. 

While I waste my life in traffic, 
	every detail is exacerbated - 

then suddenly, 

in slow motion, 

the panic kicks in. 

See, I could finally afford something I can't - 
to slip up, relax and stop planning 
	for one god damn minute. 
True, sometimes I waste cash like conservatives have it, 
	but not on starbucks or hubnuts; 
I purchase pens and other magic.

They are just 
	trinkets, 
but my 
	new 
A/C coolant 
	freezes

all five of my fingers, 
	though they Inspector Gadget when I snap 'em -
I'm telling you, you really don't know 
	what these puppies can do!

So it burns when their sensitivity is frozen
	right down to the nub, 
it hurts like the dickens, 
	it sucks, it's no fun!
	
And, distracted by this, 
	I didn't look up - 
This T-Bone car dicked me, 
	he hit me like Christ!
A flail chest injury, 
	just one right rib up - 
A spar frame protruding, 
	it's cross shaped end up. 
	
And in this 
	imaginary 
traffic jam, 
	set in the 1970s or something, 
I dunno, 
when times were simpler so they might make sense,
where I was poor somewhere clammed with people 
	rich enough to day drink, 
and cars were made out of solid steel: 
	tall miracle, I survive. 

Because health care was not completely gutted yet - 
	maybe I was living all the way in Mexico  - 
and the city's so hot and crowded 
	that he was only going thirty-five - 
so not New England, 'cuz it's so crowded up there, 
	crowded in ways a kid in the Bronx cannot escape, 
so crowded 
	that they take subways, 
that their brains invented the concept of 
	the endless wild west before freeways, 
	
Spreading all over the land like the First Woman 
	they could not accept.  
They could whitewash their crimes, 
	but not the offspring. 
And once they reached the coast, 
	they were so rich that they invented freeways,
	and three-ways. 
	
I don't think they meant much by the latter 
	other than to forget their first woman, 
But the freeways they sure fucked up, 
	just like her. 

I don't care if you kill me, 
	I just wanna get there fast!
And this boredom is torture, 
	I've heard regrets of the dying - 
They'd rather live one day in their prime 
	than sit there and live, lifeless 

A day where prime was shorthand for badass, 
	not APR; 
and only one APB was issued, 
	the videogame. 
When roads were built to build bridges, 
	not run drugs into town 
And drunk drivers didn't hit minivans 
	recently fixed to pick kids up from school 
And it wasn't my fault, I wasn't distracted, 
	I just wasn't ready 
And my hands are so cold, man, 
	they shiver, unsteady
	
I don't think about them much, 
	or other parts, broken and heavy 
I don't think at all, but if I've got to, 
	be ready
Expect meta, two players equal, 
	I'm just warning you, ese; 
	
It's likily I'll fight off your whole clan, 
	then eat with 'em
This scene is impossible, 
	I won't let you hit 'em - 
I'll move to the South, 
	my hands won't be frostbitten 
I've got rear-wheel drive, 
	do too many snow crashes 
I'm rich in the South, 
	rallying my fighters 
Local Motors production, 
	but this artist'll shoot off 
Not running my mouth, 
	I'll pull out in traffic 
Wear fingerless gloves, 
	predicted you coming 
Make love, warm blooded 
	and flooded the basement - 
So cool with warm bodies - 
	but I've been to the South, 
so that perfect day
	can not happen. 

Katrina made landfall in 2005. 
I took 11 years to arrive,
	but that's half my life.
And I don't remember traffic jams, 
	I was so tired from crying 
But most things I forget - 
	God Damn, how'd I end it?
