The Auxillary 

The Gue'la had been selected among his brothers, alone, by Shas'vre Ro'katta, but Shas'ui Sama wasn't convinced that meant his guess was any better when it came to why the mission demanded him. Carefully watching the auxillary, as his ancestors would have watched a foolish mountain [i]anuk[/i] lost on the plains, Sama took every swallow or shift of weight as a sign, gratefully, that the Gue'la was just as nervous and out of his depth as him. 

But still, some [i]anuks[/i] were poisonous. And the Gue'la was doing a very good job of pretending Sama wasn't there. 

Sama recalled the meditations on the Way of the Warrior. "[i]A hunter must be underestimated by his prey, and overestimated by his own predators."[/i] Well, it was probably more eloquent when Puretide said it, but the message had stuck. This was a still-life savannah, the rustling grass replaced by cooling fans, the beating heat of the sun inverted into a sapping, frigid chill. At any moment, it could explode into a dynamic scene, ultimately leaving a life much, much more still. 

Even beneath his thick bodysuit panels, pulsing with temperature-controlled ducts and wiring, Sama felt cold beads of sweat prick his skin. He kept his helmet cocked at an off-kilter angle, not looking directly at the Gue'la or anything else, but the wide-angle cameras easily picked up his every shallow breath and flick of the eyes. The imbalance pleased Sama, but seemingingly did not phase the Gue'la. He stared straight ahead, following the Fio as they tinkered with their machines across the bay. He was either too stupid to notice the tension, or so confident in his footing that he believed no undercurrents would sway him. From where Sama was sitting, there seemed no reason for such arrogance, but there was no way to know, and the uncertainity made his blood boil. 

A HUD-alert popped up with some nonsense about his heartbeat. Sama tore the helmet off and sat it on the cargo crates, already 

pop-up in the hud -> tears helmet off 

Gue'la brings up chicken (still-life/)

Gue'la "Sorry I gotta go" when Shas'vre approaches -> arrogance

Gue'la brings up Fio as working on -their- dropship (correct)

Gue'la didn't realize Sama was staring at him/part of the team 

"[name] did not notice you because you were one of many. Why pay attention to any insect when you are inside their hive? At first, you notice nothing, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. Then, the patterns of movement become clear. Distractions, if disruptive, are jarring and obvious; if innocuous, simply ignored as a fixture."

-> Sama gets angry about 'disrespect' to Tau way + implying he's lazy 

"A Gue'la simply ignoring you was enough to elevate your vitals to combat-lull levels."

-> :o @ insight -> "I may be more verbose than Puretide, but I pay attention."
